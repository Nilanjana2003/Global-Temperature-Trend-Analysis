# 🌍 Global Temperature Trend Analysis

This project visualizes the change in global temperature anomalies over time, helping to highlight the accelerating patterns of global warming. Using real-world climate data and Python's data visualization libraries, we generate a clear and impactful plot that shows how Earth’s temperature has evolved from the 19th century to the present day.


## 📌 Description

* The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains yearly global temperature anomaly data.
* The script reads the CSV file, processes it using pandas, and visualizes the anomaly trend using matplotlib.
* The final outputs are saved as plot images in this repository.


## 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Python** 🐍
* **pandas**: for data manipulation
* **matplotlib**: for plotting the trend
* **VS Code**: for running and developing the script


## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nilanjana2003/Global-Temperature-Trend-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the main directory:

   ```bash
   cd Global-Temperature-Trend-Analysis
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python main\ python\ files/main.py
   ```



## 🌱 Motivation

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. This project aims to spread awareness by visualizing how Earth’s temperature anomalies have changed over the decades in a simple and impactful way.
