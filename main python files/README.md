# Global-Temperature-Trend-Analysis
 Visualizing Global Temperature Trends (2000–2019) using Five-Year Moving Averages of Anomalies. A data-driven look at climate change using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

  🌍 Global Temperature Anomaly Analysis (2000–2019)

  What is a Temperature Anomaly?

A temperature anomaly represents how much warmer (or cooler) a given period was compared to a historical baseline (usually the 20th-century average). Rather than plotting raw yearly temperatures, we use five-year moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and better reveal long-term climate trends.

  What This Project Does

- Cleans and filters global temperature data from CSV format
- Computes and visualizes five-year average anomalies
- Generates a clean and interpretable line graph using `matplotlib`

  Tools Used

- Python 
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib 
- VS Code

 Key Insights

- Earth's average temperature has steadily increased since 2000.
- Five-year average anomalies show a clear global warming trend.
- By 2019, the anomaly exceeds 1.0°C above the baseline, a significant change.
